            Puerto Galera is 2-3 hours away from Manila so this is a place Metro
            Manila dwellers frequently go to. Puerta Galera has dozens of Dive
            sites suitable for all levels of scuba diving experience.

            Only a few hours away by car from Manila, this was my second trip to
            Zambales but my first time in Potipot Island. The water is pristine
            and the sand is almost as fine as Boracay. I went with my friends
            for a long weekend trip. A year before, I tried surfing for the
            first time in San Narciso, Zambales.

            Working as a flight attendant, this was one of the places I
            frequently stayed at and easily one of my favorites. The food is
            amazing, the cost of living is cheaper than in Manila, highly
            urbanized yet numerous white sand beaches and falls are just a short
            drive away.

            The first regional/out-of-the-country flight working as a flight
            attendant was to this vibrant city. Known for many things but the
            cafes and street food are probably what stood out to me the most.

            activities to do. I went with friends for a long weekend but we were
            able to squeeze in a lot of
            <span>food in our bellies</span> activities such as banana boat
            riding, beach paragliding, and kayaking.

            The central business district of the Philippines. I've been here
            uncountable times but didn't work in until 2014. One of the foodie
            places in Metro Manila, several restaurants open every week here and
            some of the top Michelin star restaurants in the PH are found here.

            Right next to Makati, and is as vibrant, diverse, and busy as

            here, from Japanese to French and even Balkan food.

            Restaurant/food crawling is probably the best way to enjoy Bangkok.
            The temples are interesting as well but they tend to get crowded, so
            the food was definitely the highlight of our trip here. It's also
            amazing how we purchased flight tickets to Phuket on the same day at
            the airport yet they were very reasonably priced and the service was
            great.

            Originally wanting to go to Chiang Mai, this was my husband and I's
            second choice but it turned out to be a great choice, we went back a
            year after. Nai Harn beach in the south, next to Rawaii is probably
            the best spot and most family/couple-friendly beach. Just like the
            locals, we drove around in scooters here which was a lot of fun.

            Due to its proximity to Bohol, we were able to go to Cebu via an
            hour-long boat trip. We originally wanted to go to the famous
            Kawasan falls and experience canyoneering, but due to the dry
            weather we only got to do whale shark (butanding) watching, which
            already made the trip very memorable.

            good restaurants, activities to do, and sights to see. This is also
            where my husband and I exchanged our vows. Famous for the cooler
            climate due to higher altitudes and Taal - an island within an
            island within an island - and its volcano, which recently made news
            due to the explosive eruption.
